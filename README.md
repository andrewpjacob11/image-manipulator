# Image Manipulation Project

## Overview

This project processes input images in `.ppm`, `.jpg`, or `.pdf` formats and applies one of the following manipulations:

- **Image Blur**: Softens the image by averaging the colors of neighboring pixels.
- **Image Sharpening**: Enhances the edges within the image, making it appear more defined.
- **Greyscale**: Converts the image to shades of grey, removing all color information.
- **Sepia**: Applies a warm brown tone to the image, giving it a vintage appearance.

## Features

- Supports multiple image formats: `.ppm`, `.jpg`, and `.pdf`.
- Provides several image manipulation options, including blurring, sharpening, greyscale, and sepia.
- Thoroughly tested using JUnit 5.

## Testing

This project uses **JUnit 5** for testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the image manipulations.
